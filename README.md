# AddPay PHP
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dwyl/esta.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dwyl/esta)

A PHP package to assist in developing applications communicating with the AddPay API. The package already exists elsewhere, but due to someone's lack of understanding of API's, this is a replica with **spoon-feeding methods** for non-developers that don't know how to write object orientated code or use native PHP functions to build JSON payloads.
