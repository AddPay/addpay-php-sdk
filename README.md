# AddPay PHP
A PHP package to assist in developing applications communicating with the AddPay API. The package contains minimalistic wrappers around the Public, Private and Open API's. This package was written specifically for an incredibly difficult individual who has no understanding of JSON API's and thinks that to add a new field to a JSON object, a new PHP class is required. :facepalm:
